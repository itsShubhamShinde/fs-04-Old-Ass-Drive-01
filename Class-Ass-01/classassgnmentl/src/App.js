      <h1>Learn web development</h1>
<br />
      <p>Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete </p>
      <p>beginners to web development with all that they need to start coding websites</p>
      <br />
      <p>The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to</p>
      <p>take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start</p>
      <p>making your way, learning from <a href="">the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to</p>
      <p>advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.</p>
      <br />
      <p>If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging - we will hold</p>
      <p>your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics</p>
      <p>properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web</p>
      <p>development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class</p>
      <p>materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how</p>
      <p>web technologies work.</p>
